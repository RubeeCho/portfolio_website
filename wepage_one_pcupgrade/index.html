                    <h3>TL;DR</h3>

                    <p>
                        Built my first PC in 2021 for $918, used it heavily for 4+ years until WiFi and performance
                        issues emerged. Upgraded the core components (motherboard, CPU, RAM) via Facebook Marketplace
                        for $140 net cost, transforming it into a faster RGB build in just one day.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Beginning: First Desktop Adventure</h3>

                    <p>
                        After years of relying solely on laptops, I finally decided to make the leap to desktop
                        computing. On March 7, 2021, I took the plunge and ordered parts for my very first PC build.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The initial build was modest—totaling $918.18 before tax—but it represented something
                        significant: my transition from portable computing to a dedicated workspace.

                    <h3>The Learning Curve</h3>

                    <p>
                        The components arrived gradually over the course of a week, and when the final box was
                        delivered, the real adventure began. Armed with countless YouTube tutorials and a healthy dose
                        of determination, I embarked on my first PC assembly.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/image_3.jpg" alt="[picture of the boxes]">

                    <p>
                        What I expected to be a straightforward afternoon project stretched into two full days. Between
                        figuring out cable management, ensuring proper component seating, getting the system to POST,
                        and installing Windows, the learning curve was steeper than anticipated. But when those first
                        LEDs lit up and the system successfully booted, the satisfaction was unmatched.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Four Years of Faithful Service</h3>

                    <p>
                        That humble build served me incredibly well. Over the next four years, it became my
                        entertainment hub for dozens of Netflix series, my gaming rig for several hundred hours of
                        gameplay, and my development workstation where I wrote thousands of lines of code. It was the
                        reliable foundation of my digital life.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Signs of Age</h3>

                    <p>
                        By May 23rd, 2025, after more than four years of faithful service, the system began showing its
                        age. Performance had noticeably declined, but the real pain point was the WiFi card—internet
                        speeds had degraded significantly, impacting everything from streaming to file downloads.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/image_5.jpg" alt="[picture of wifi speed test]">

                    <p>
                        Rather than simply replacing the WiFi card, I saw an opportunity for a more comprehensive
                        upgrade that would breathe new life into the entire system.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Smart Upgrade Strategy</h3>

                    <p>
                        This time around, I took a different approach. Instead of buying refurbished or brand new
                        components from Amazon, I turned to Facebook Marketplace for better deals. I found an excellent
                        bundle: an MSI B550 motherboard paired with a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and two 8GB G.Skill DDR4 RAM
                        sticks. I negotiated the $275 listing down to $250—a great deal for such a solid combo."

                    <h3>The Transformation</h3>

                    <p>
                        The upgrade process was a complete platform swap—out with the old ASRock Intel-based motherboard
                        and in with the new MSI AMD setup. I replaced the non-RGB Corsair RAM with the RGB G.Skill
                        modules and installed an RGB CPU cooler I had been keeping in storage, transforming not just the
                        performance but the entire aesthetic of the build.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/image_7.jpg" alt="[picture of messy room with parts all over the place]">

                    <p>
                        With four years of experience under my belt, what once took me two days now required only one.
                        The familiarity with the process made everything smoother, from cable routing to component
                        installation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Economics of Smart Upgrading</h3>

                    <p>
                        To offset the upgrade cost, I bundled all the replaced components—the old motherboard, CPU, CPU
                        cooler, RAM, and problematic WiFi card—and sold them on Facebook Marketplace for $110.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/image_9.PNG" alt="[picture of facebook marketplace sale]">
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li id="list-title">Total Investment Breakdown:</li>
                        <li>New components: $250</li>
                        <li>Sale of old parts: -$110</li>
                        <li>Net upgrade cost: $140</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Results</h3>

                    <p>
                        The transformation was remarkable. The new system not only resolved the WiFi connectivity issues
                        but delivered significantly improved performance across all tasks. The addition of RGB lighting
                        gave it a fresh, modern appearance that matched its enhanced capabilities.

                        Total time investment: approximately 12 hours spread across sourcing parts, performing the
                        upgrade, and selling the old components. For $140 and one day of work, I essentially transformed
                        my aging system into a modern, high-performance machine.

                        The experience reinforced an important lesson: sometimes the smartest upgrade path isn't buying
                        everything new, but strategically sourcing quality used components and maximizing the value of
                        what you're replacing.
